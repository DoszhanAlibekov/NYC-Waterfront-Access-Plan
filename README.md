#NYC-Waterfront-Access-Plan

NYU Web Mapping Classâ€™s Final Project

The map provides an overview of NYC Waterfront Public Access Plan. As part of the local government community, Waterfront Alliance, in corporation with NYC Department of City Planning, is providing extensive work to promote the waterfront development and enrich its access to residents.

Doszhan Alibekov, NYU Wagner grad student, who also a fellow at the Waterfront Alliance, aims to show how accessible waterfront in New York York is, by showing it on the map. The user can go ahead and move the mouse over green areas, which means they are accessible for public. When the mouse hovers an area, one can see the name of the park and who it belongs to whether it is public agency or private.
